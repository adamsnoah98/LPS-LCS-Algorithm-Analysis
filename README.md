# Setup 

Java source code requires Java 8 or better; furthermore, test code uses JUnit 4.12, so this must be added to the project using Maven 
or another preferred method. Python visualization code is included and requires MatPlotLib. Download this to your class path
with your preferred package manager if needed.
